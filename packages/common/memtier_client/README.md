memtier_benchmark
=================

memtier_benchmark is a command line utility developed by Redis Labs (formerly Garantia Data Ltd.) for load generation and bechmarking NoSQL key-value databases. It offers the following:

* Support for both Redis and Memcache protocols (text and binary)
* Multi-threaded multi-client execution
* Multiple configuration options, including:
 * Read:Write ratio
 * Random and sequential key name pattern policies
 * Random or ranged key expiration
 * Redis cluster
 * TLS support
 * ...and much more

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The following libraries are required for building:

* libevent 2.0.10 or newer.
* libpcre 8.x.
* OpenSSL (unless TLS support is disabled by `./configure --disable-tls`).

The following tools are required
* autoconf
* automake
* pkg-config
* GNU make
* GCC C++ compiler

#### CentOS 6.x

On a CentOS 6.x system, use the following to install prerequisites:
```
# yum install autoconf automake make gcc-c++
# yum install pcre-devel zlib-devel libmemcached-devel
```

CentOS 6.4 ships with older versions of libevent, which must be manually built
and installed as follows:

To download, build and install libevent-2.0.21:
```
$ wget https://github.com/downloads/libevent/libevent/libevent-2.0.21-stable.tar.gz
$ tar xfz libevent-2.0.21-stable.tar.gz
$ pushd libevent-2.0.21-stable
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ popd
```

The above steps will install into /usr/local so it does not confict with the
distribution-bundled versions.  The last step is to set up the
PKG_CONFIG_PATH so configure can find the newly installed library.

```
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}
```

Then proceed to follow the build instructions below.

#### Ubuntu/Debian

On Ubuntu/Debian distributions, simply install all prerequisites as follows:

```
# apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libpcre3-dev libevent-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev libssl-dev
```

#### macOS

To build natively on macOS, use Homebrew to install the required dependencies::

```
$ brew install autoconf automake libtool libevent pkg-config openssl@1.1
```

When running `./configure`, if it fails to find libssl it may be necessary to
tweak the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable:

```
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig ./configure
```

### Building and installing

After downloading the source tree, use standard autoconf/automake commands::

```
$ autoreconf -ivf
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```

## Using Docker

```
$ docker build -t memtier_benchmark .
$ docker run --rm memtier_benchmark --help
```

## Using memtier_benchmark

See the included manpage or run::

```
$ memtier_benchmark --help
```

for command line options.

### Cluster mode

#### Connections

When using the cluster-mode option, each client opens one connection for each node.
So, when using a large number of threads and clients, the user must verify that he is not
limited by the maximum number of file descriptors.

#### Using sequential key pattern

When there is an asymmetry between the Redis nodes and user set
the --requests option, there may be gaps in the generated keys.

Also, the ratio and the key generator is per client (and not connection).
In this case, setting the ratio to 1:1 does not guarantee 100% hits because
the keys spread to different connections/nodes.
