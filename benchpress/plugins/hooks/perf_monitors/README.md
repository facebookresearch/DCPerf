# Monitoring Perf & System Telemetry While Benchmarking

This README introduces usage and requirements of the `perf` hook, a Benchpress plugin
designed to automatically monitor and collect important system performance telemetries
while running DCPerf benchmarks.

`perf` hook is capable of monitoring the following metrics:

* CPU utilization, broken down by each categories (e.g. %usr, %sys, %wait, %irq, etc)
* Memory capacity utilization
* CPU Frequency
* Network bandwidth
* IPC
* Microarch telemetry (e.g. memory bandwidth, cache miss rate and
  frontend / backend boundedness)


## Getting started

To collect these system and performance metrics while running DCPerf benchmark,
simply append `-k perf` after the command you will use to run the benchmark.

For example, to monitor performance while running Mediawiki:

```bash
./benchpress_cli.py run oss_performance_mediawiki_mlp -k perf
```

TaoBench, with custom parameters:

```bash
./benchpress_cli.py run tao_bench_autoscale -i '{"num_servers": 4, "memsize": 512, "interface_name": "enP8s6"}' -k perf
```

### Supplying custom parameters for `perf` hook

If you need to supply custom parameters to one or more of the perf monitors to
override the default settings, append the following after your Benchpress run command:

```bash
-k perf -a '{"perf": {"monitor_1": {"key1": <value1>, "key2": <value2>, ...}, "monitor_2": {"key3": <value3>, ...}, ...}}'
```

The principle is this: `-a` is the positional argument to supply custom parameters for
on-demand hooks. It accepts a JSON string with each hook name as the key and the parameters
for that hook as the value (usually another JSON object).

Regarding the `perf` hook, it accepts a JSON object as the parameter, with each monitor name
as the key and the parameters for that monitor as the values.

For example, if you would like to set `is_zen4` to `true` for the `topdown` monitor,
append the following after your benchpress run command:

```bash
-k perf -a '{"perf": {"topdown": {"is_zen4": true}}}'
```

Another example: if you want to set the collection interval of `mpstat`, `memstat` and `netstat`
to 1 second, append the following:

```bash
-k perf -a '{"perf": {"mpstat": {"interval": 1}, "memstat": {"interval": 1}, "netstat": {"interval": 1}}}
```

We will discuss the available perf monitors and the parameters they accept in the following
sections of this doc.

download packet rate (`_rx_packets_per_sec`), upload bandwidth (`_tx_bytes_per_sec`)
and upload packet rate (`_tx_packets_per_sec`) of every available NIC
installed in the system. The metrics are prefixed with the name of the NIC.

#### Requirements

Statistics files are available under `/sys/class/net/<interface-name>/statistics`

#### Parameters

* `interval`: Metrics collection interval in seconds, default is `5`
* `additional_counters`: Additional fields in
`/sys/class/net/<interface-name>/statistics` you want this monitor to
collect. Optional, should be supplied in the form of a list.

### `cpufreq`

Monitors CPU frequency during benchmark. The methodology is to take the average
of all numbers collected from `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq`.

#### Requirements

Your system supports CPU frequency reporting in
`/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq`.

#### Parameters

* `interval`: Metrics collection interval in seconds, default is `5`

#### Output

`benchmark_metrics_<run_id>/cpufreq.csv`

### `topdown`

`topdown` monitors microarchitecture telemetries, such as cache miss rates,
memory bandwidth, frontend or backend boundedness, MIPS and IPC during
the benchmark. We currently support the following processors:

* Intel CPUs
* AMD Zen-series CPUs
* NVIDIA Grace

#### Requirements

* `perf` tool
* For Intel systems, please download the latest release of
  [PerfSpect](https://github.com/intel/PerfSpect), extract the package and copy
  `perf-collect` and `perf-postprocess` to `<DCPerf-path>/perfspect` directory.
* For AMD and NVIDIA systems, we require `pandas` python package for
  post-processing
* For NVIDIA systems, please use Linux kernel 6.4.3 or later and make sure the
  kernel module `arm_cspmu_module` is loaded. If not, please install the module
  at `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/perf/arm_cspmu/arm_cspmu_module.ko`

#### Parameters

* `is_zen4`: (AMD Only, optional) Monitor perf counters specialized for AMD Zen4+
  processors regardless of the CPU model name. This is helpful to monitor perf
  telemetries on engineering sample CPUs which often do not have formal model
  names. If you are testing on an AMD ES CPU with Zen4 or newer generation of core
  architecture, please set this parameter to `true` in order to enable the
  Zen4-specific metrics.

#### Output

Note: all files discussed in this section are under `benchmark_metrics_<run_id>`
folder

Intel:

* `topdown-intel.html`: An interactive webpage where you can view the collected
  metrics in browser. It includes bottleneck analysis, time-series graph in CPU,
  memory bandwidth utilization and cache miss rates, as well as summary of other
  metrics.
* `topdown-intel.sys.average.csv`: A summary spreadsheet showing the average, p95,
  min and max of the microarch metrics throughout the entire benchmark.
* `topdown-intel.sys.csv`: A time-series sheet recording the microarch metrics
  every 5 seconds during the benchmark.
* `perf-collect.csv`: Raw perf event data collected by Perfspect during benchmark

AMD:

* `amd-perf-collector-summary.csv`: A summary spreadsheet showing the average,
  stddev, min, p95 and max of the microarch metrics observed throughout the
  benchmark.
* `amd-perf-collector-timeseries.csv`: The time-series sheet recording the
  microarch metrics during the benchmark, in the interval of 5 secs.
* `amd-perf-collector.log`: The raw perf event data collected during the benchmark

For Zen4+ CPUs, there are also the following files:

* `amd-zen4-perf-collector-summary.csv`
* `amd-zen4-perf-collector-timeseries.csv`
* `amd-zen4-perf-collector.log`

NVIDIA Grace:

* `arm-perf-collector-summary.csv`: A summary spreadsheet showing the average,
  stddev, min, p95 and max of the microarch metrics observed throughout the
  benchmark.
* `arm-perf-collector-timeseries.csv`: The time-series sheet recording the
  microarch metrics during the benchmark, in the interval of 5 secs.
* `arm-perf-collector.log`: The raw perf event data collected during the benchmark.

### `perfstat`

`perfstat` collects performance counters through `perf stat` command. By default
it will only collect IPC every 5 seconds, but you can configure this monitor with
custom parameters to let it also collect other PMU event counters. With that being
said, we expect the `topdown` monitor to collect enough micro-arch metrics so
you don't need to use this in particular. You may use this if the `topdown` monitor
is not compatible with the CPU you are experimenting with or you would like to monitor
certain events that `topdown` does not include.

#### Requirements

* `perf` tool

#### Parameters

* `interval`: Metrics collection interval in seconds, default is `5`
* `additional_events`: Additional events you want this monitor to collect.
  Optional, should be supplied in the form of a list. Available events can be
  referenced from `perf list` command. Supplying an unsupported event will
  cause `perf stat` to error out in the very beginning and therefore this monitor
  would not be able to collect any meaningful numbers.

#### Output

```

## Logging

Warnings and errors related to the perf monitors will be printed to the terminal
or written to `benchpress.log`. If the perf monitor executes any external
command (such as `mpstat` or `perf stat`), the `stderr` output will also be
redirected to `benchpress.log`. Therefore, if you observe one or more of the
monitors is not running properly, you can look for `benchpress.log` to find out
possible cause.

## Analysis tips

### How to get the average of last X seconds of metrics?

Many of the DCPerf benchmarks have a warm-up period and then follow by the actual
benchmarking period. Thus, it's important for us to calculate statistical data
for the last X amount of time.

In Google Sheets, we can use the formula like this:

```
=AVERAGE(FILTER(<RANGE>,ARRAYFORMULA(ROW(<RANGE>)>COUNT(<RANGE>)-<NROWS>+1)))
```

Replace `<RANGE>` with the range of data you would like to include for calculation,
and replace `<NROWS>` with how many rows from bottom you want to select. `AVERAGE`
means taking average of the rows selected, you can replace it with other functions
if you would like to calculate other statistical data such as `STDDEV`.

For example, for Feedsim we want to calculate the average of a certain metrics (e.g.
CPU util) in the last 5 minutes of the benchmark. If the metrics collection interval
is the default 5 secs, `<NROWS>` will be `300/5=60`. If the range of data is `C4:C`,
the formula would be like this;

```
=AVERAGE(FILTER(C4:C,ARRAYFORMULA(ROW(C4:C)>COUNT(C4:C)-60+1)))
```

Another example, for Spark benchmark, we want to calculate the average metrics for
the compute-intensive Stage 2.0 period. Since Stage 2.0 is the last stage of the
Spark query workload, that equals to taking average of the last N rows where N is
Stage 2.0 execution time divided by metrics interval. Suppose the Stage 2.0 execution
time is 172s, interval is 5s, then `<NROWS>` will be `ceil(172/5) = 35`. If the range
of data is `G4:G`, the formula would be:

```
=AVERAGE(FILTER(G4:G,ARRAYFORMULA(ROW(G4:G)>COUNT(G4:G)-35+1)))
```
